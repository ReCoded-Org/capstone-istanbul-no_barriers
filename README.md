# NO BARRIERS
The main purpose is to connect refugees and people in need to NGOs in Turkey.

## How we did
We conducted competitors' analysis, created user flows, studied different layouts and colors to create No-Barriers. Afterwards, we created the prototype on Figma.
We used Agile methodologies to bring continuous integration and deployment. Every team member have their daily tasks, and we did daily stand-ups and retrospective meeting to improve every week our work flow.

## Technologies we used
We used mainly React and Bootstrap for the front-end, firebase for the back-end, wordpress API for the blog, Jest for snapshot tests and Eslint for checking the code format.
